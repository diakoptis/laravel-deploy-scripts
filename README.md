# laravel-deploy-scripts
Shell scripts to manage Laravel app deployment on an Linux server running Nginx. This was built for Laravel 5.8, but should work with any version 5.0+. There are currently three main scripts, two to deploy and one to revert to a previous deployment. There is also .env example file for your custom variables and a script to handle the git post-receive hook.

## Overview

The deploy script will deploy a Laravel application with almost zero downtime. Instead of updating the currently running version, it checks out a new clone of the passed in branch and builds it in a timestamped folder, then recreates a symlink at the very end. The symlink represents the root folder of your website. It will only keep 5 copies of the site and will delete any sites older than the fifth.

## Assumptions
* On your Linux server, you must have your root folder be the same name as your git repository name. For example, your root could be located at /var/www/html/app-name. This folder will actually be a symlink to the current build.
* In your working directory (/var/www/html in the previous example), you must place your production .env file. The contents of this file will be copied to every clone you make.
* Youâ€™ll need to use a deploy key for SSH access to your repo.

Note: this script will not run database migrations.

## Installation
* Clone Repository.
* Rename example.env.sh to .env.sh
* Update the variables in .env.sh
* Remove .sh from all filenames except .env.sh.
* SSH into your server. Copy the scripts to your linux server at /usr/local/bin/. 
* Make script files executable.

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/manual-deploy /usr/local/bin/revert /usr/local/bin/git-deploy /usr/local/bin/git-post-receive
```

** Stop here and jump to the Manual Deploy section if you do not want to tie your deployments to git. I would recommend setting up your git remote, but it is more work. If you just want to try the script out, use the manual-deploy script. **

* Go to your root file and create a bare git repository. **Be sure to update sitename.git**
```
cd ~
mkdir sitename.git
cd sitename.git
git init --bare
```

* Open the post-receive file. **Be sure to update sitename.git**
```
sudo nano ~/sitename.git/hooks/post-receive
```

* Insert the following.
```
git-post-receive
```

* Make post-receive file executable. **Be sure to update sitename.git**
```
sudo chmod +x ~/sitename.git/hooks/post-receive
```

* Allow git-deploy script to function without entering a sudo password. **Be sure to update LINUX_USERNAME to your user or group.**
```
sudo visudo
LINUX_USERNAME ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/git-deploy *
```

* Exit the server
* On your local machine, navigate in terminal to your project repository.
* Add a remote repository. **Be sure to update your ssh information.**
```
git remote add REMOTE_NAME 
ssh://username@ip.address/home/sitename/sitename.git
```

*Thats it! You should be able to now run the following command from your repository folder on your local machine.
```
git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_TO_PUSH
```

## How to Manually Deploy
The manual deploy script allows you to clone a repository branch without having to set up a git remote or have changes in your repository. You can run the manual deploy script with the following command format.
```
manual-deploy branch-name
```

## Results of Deployment
The script will take "app-name" from the .env.sh file and create a folder formated with the time, such as app-name-2019_01_01-15-34-65. Inside this folder, it will clone your repository branch. Once that is finished, it will run composer, update permissions, copy your .env file, and restart your server. Finally, it will create a symlink with the title of your app-name and point it at this new folder. 

By doing this, you still have your previous build and can revert it back if needed. 

## How to Revert Back to a Previous Deployment
All you have to do is run the revert command with the following format
```
revert app-folder
```

So in reality it may look like the following:

```
revert app-name-2019_01_01-15-34-65
```
